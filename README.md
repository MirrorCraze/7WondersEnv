# 7WondersEnv
7Wonders board game is a complex game with multiple difficulties for AI bot training, such as large state space, hidden information, 
asymmetric initial states from different types of boards, trading system, effects and randomness.

This project creates an OpenAI Environments for reinforcement learning algorithm. The whole game system, environment, reward systems are implemented.
The environment also opens not only for Bot VS Bot VS Bot, but also Bots VS Human. 

Deep Q-learning algorithm is also implemented here using the policy network and target network. Moreover, two other bots, which are Rule-based AI and Random AI
are implemented.
